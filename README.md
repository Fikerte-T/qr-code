- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I plan to learn  Tailwind CSS and/or styled components and use them in my future projects. I want to also focus on SASS and be comfortable to use it because its crucial for efficent CSS code. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - I find this website helpful because its a quick remider for HTML tags and CSS properties.

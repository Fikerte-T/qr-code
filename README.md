## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I plan to learn  Tailwind CSS and/or styled components and use them in my future projects. I want to also focus on SASS and be comfortable to use it because its crucial for efficent CSS code. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - I find this website helpful because its a quick remider for HTML tags and CSS properties.
